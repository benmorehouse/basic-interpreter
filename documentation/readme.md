# Documentation

This repository shows the reasoning as, as well as explanation of, certain features across the server.

I would strongly suggest you graze through these markdown files in the order that follows:


[Abstract](main.md)

[Interpreter](interpreter.md)

---

[front end](frontend.md)

[server side](server.md)

[authentication](authentication.md)

[file storage](file_store.md)
